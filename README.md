   - Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Save the JavaScript Code**:
   - Save the provided JavaScript code to a file named `polynomial.js`.

3. **Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   - Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows).

4. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where `polynomial.js` is saved. For example:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/directory
     ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using Node.js with the following command:

     ```bash
     node polynomial.js
     ```

6. **View Output**:
   - The output will be printed in the terminal, displaying the constant term for each test case.
