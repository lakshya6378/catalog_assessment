Prerequisites
JavaScript runtime environment (Browser or Node.js).
Setup and Running the Code
1. Prepare the JavaScript File
Save the JavaScript code into a file named polynomial.js.

2. Running the Code
Using a Browser's Developer Console
Open the browser's developer console:

For most browsers, press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac), and then select the "Console" tab.
Copy the contents of polynomial.js and paste it into the console.

Press Enter to execute the code.

Using Node.js
Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.

Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
node polynomial.js
Output
The script will print the constant term of the polynomial for each test case:

For jsonInput1:

mathematica
Copy code
Constant term for jsonInput1: 3
For jsonInput2:

mathematica
Copy code
Constant term for jsonInput2: 28735619723864
Notes
Dependencies: No external libraries or dependencies are required for this script.
Assumptions: The code assumes valid JSON input and sufficient data points (at least k).
Feel free to adjust the sample JSON inputs and test cases as needed.
